No additional preconditions or effects are needed beyond ensuring the character is next to the object.\n- **switch_on**: This action turns on the washing machine. The precondition ensures the washing machine can be opened and is currently open and plugged in, and the character is next to it. The effect turns the washing machine on.\n- **grab**: This action grabs an object. The precondition checks if the object is grabbable and if the character is next to it. The effect sets the character as holding the object either in the right hand or left hand.\n- **close**: This action closes the washing machine. The precondition ensures the washing machine can be opened and is currently open, and the character is next to it. The effect closes the washing machine."

The precondition ensures that the object is grabbable and movable, and the character is next to the destination object, which is in the same room as the character. The effect places the object inside the destination object and removes the object's grabbability and movability.\n\n2. **open**: This action opens an object. The precondition ensures that the object can be opened, and the character is next to the object, which is in the same room as the character. The effect opens the object and closes the closed state.\n\n3. **grab**: This action grabs an object. The precondition ensures that the object is grabbable and movable, and the character is next to the object, which is in the same room as the character. The effect makes the character hold the object, removing the object's grabbability and movability.\n\n4. **walk_towards**: This action does not change the state but ensures that the character is next to the object. The precondition checks that the character is next to the object, which is in the same room as the character. The effect keeps the character next to the object.\n\nThese actions, when combined, allow the character to move the food into the freezer, open the freezer, and place the food inside it, thereby achieving the goal."

        "llm_output": "To solve the problem, we need to define actions that will allow us to achieve the goal conditions from the initial state. Specifically, we need to open the freezer and ensure it remains plugged in. Let's break down the required steps and define the necessary actions.\n\n### Action Definitions\n\n#### Action: Open Freezer\nWe need to define the `open` action to open the freezer. The precondition should include the character being next to the freezer and holding nothing. The effect should be that the freezer is open.\n\n```pddl\n(:action open_freezer\n  :parameters (?char - character ?freezer - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (next_to ?char ?freezer)\n                  (not (holds_rh ?char ?obj))\n                  (not (holds_lh ?char ?obj))\n                  (closed ?freezer)\n                  (can_open ?freezer)\n                  (inside_room ?freezer dining_room)\n                  )\n  :effect (and\n           (open ?freezer)\n           (not (closed ?freezer))\n           (not (next_to ?char ?freezer))\n           )\n)\n```\n\n#### Action: Plug In Freezer\nNext, we need to define the `plug_in_freezer` action to ensure the freezer remains plugged in. The precondition should include the character being next to the freezer and holding nothing. The effect should be that the freezer is plugged in.\n\n```pddl\n(:action plug_in_freezer\n  :parameters (?char - character ?freezer - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (next_to ?char ?freezer)\n                  (not (holds_rh ?char ?obj))\n                  (not (holds_lh ?char ?obj))\n                  (plugged_out ?freezer)\n                  (has_plug ?freezer)\n                  (inside_room ?freezer dining_room)\n                  )\n  :effect (and\n           (plugged_in ?freezer)\n           (not (plugged_out ?freezer))\n           (not (next_to ?char ?freezer))\n           )\n)\n```\n\n### Concatenated Actions in JSON Format\n\nNow, let's concatenate all the actions into a single string and wrap it in a JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"(:action open_freezer\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?freezer - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                  (next_to ?char ?freezer)\\n                  (not (holds_rh ?char ?obj))\\n                  (not (holds_lh ?char ?obj))\\n                  (closed ?freezer)\\n                  (can_open ?freezer)\\n                  (inside_room ?freezer dining_room)\\n                  )\\n  :effect (and\\n           (open ?freezer)\\n           (not (closed ?freezer))\\n           (not (next_to ?char ?freezer))\\n           )\\n)\\n(:action plug_in_freezer\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?freezer - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                  (next_to ?char ?freezer)\\n                  (not (holds_rh ?char ?obj))\\n                  (not (holds_lh ?char ?obj))\\n                  (plugged_out ?freezer)\\n                  (has_plug ?freezer)\\n                  (inside_room ?freezer dining_room)\\n                  )\\n  :effect (and\\n           (plugged_in ?freezer)\\n           (not (plugged_out ?freezer))\\n           (not (next_to ?char ?freezer))\\n           )\\n)\"\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON string contains the definitions of the two actions required to achieve the goal."

The precondition is that the object is grabbable and the character is next to it, and the character is not already holding anything. The effect is that the character starts holding the object in the right hand.\n\n3. **turn_to**: This action allows the character to face an object. The precondition is that the character is next to the object. The effect is that the character is facing the object.\n\n4. **switch_on**: This action turns on an object that has a switch and is currently plugged in and off. The precondition is that the character is holding the object, the object has a switch, the object is off and plugged in. The effect is that the object turns on."

These conditions ensure that the character can grab the object and plug it in.\n   - **Effect**: Plugging in the object changes its state from unplugged (`plugged_out`) to plugged in (`plugged_in`). Additionally, the object is no longer grabbable (`not (grabbable ?obj)`).\n\n2. **Walk Towards Action**:\n   - **Precondition**: The character is next to the object (`next_to ?char ?obj`). This ensures that the character can move towards the object.\n   - **Effect**: There is no effect since walking does not change the state of any object.\n\n3. **Switch On Action**:\n   - **Precondition**: The object must be a switch (`can_open ?obj`), be open (`open ?obj`), and be next to the character (`next_to ?char ?obj`). These conditions ensure that the character can turn the switch on.\n   - **Effect**: Switching on the object changes its state from off (`off`) to on (`on`).\n\nThese actions, when combined and ordered appropriately, will allow the character to plug in the computer and switch it on, thereby achieving the goal of having the computer turned on."

The precondition checks if the object is grabbable and is next to the character.\n- **open**: This action opens the object.

Given the initial conditions and goal, the action should simply make the character move towards the cat.\n\nHere is the correct PDDL action definition:\n\n```pddl\n(:action walk_towards\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (inside ?char bathroom)\n                  (inside ?obj home_office)\n                  (movable ?obj)\n                  (not (next_to ?char ?obj))\n                )\n  :effect (and\n           (next_to ?char ?obj)\n           (not (next_to ?char ?obj))\n         )\n)\n```\n\nBut to fit the exact problem requirements, we simplify it as follows:\n\n```pddl\n(:action walk_towards\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (inside ?char bathroom)\n                  (inside ?obj home_office)\n                  (movable ?obj)\n                  (not (next_to ?char ?obj))\n                )\n  :effect (and\n           (next_to ?char ?obj)\n         )\n)\n```\n\nSo the complete solution in JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"(:action walk_towards\\n  :parameters (?char - character ?obj - object)\\n  :precondition (and\\n                  (inside ?char bathroom)\\n                  (inside ?obj home_office)\\n                  (movable ?obj)\\n                  (not (next_to ?char ?obj))\\n                )\\n  :effect (and\\n           (next_to ?char ?obj)\\n         )\\n)\"}\n```"

Based on the problem, the action should move a character closer to an object. However, since the initial state does not require the character to be next to the object to start walking towards it, and the goal is simply to be next to the object, we can infer that the character can start moving without any specific precondition being true. Therefore, the precondition is empty. The effect is also empty because the action is about the movement process, and no explicit state change is required to be represented in the effect.\n\nGiven the problem file, the `walk_towards` action does not need to enforce any additional conditions beyond those implied by the problem itself. The character just needs to eventually end up next to the object, which aligns with the goal. Thus, the action is simplified to just moving the character towards the object without any specific requirements or changes in state during the action itself."

The effect indicates the character is holding the object in their right hand.\n5. **close**: This action closes an object that can be opened.
